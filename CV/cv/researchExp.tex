      We are researching the possibility of an attack on networks that use the combination of PoS-based protocols and DAG-based network protocols, to prove that using PoS in its current state with some DAG-based network protocols like SPECTRE is insecure.

      We are working on an alternative consensus protocol based on Proof of Activity to combine the benefits of using both the PoS and PoA protocols. We have watched a series of courses and read an abundant number of papers on similar ideas. The research has been finished and is currently being finalized.
